# code-tank
An entire repository dedicated to my small web-apps, challenges, learning materials, and notes on what I learned related to computer science and programming.

## Goals
I want to build more things. This repository is meant to keep me accountable on learning and building NEW things. I want to explore other languages and ways of engineering programs. I will dive into topics on a deeper level so I can become more comfortable with them in my field. This is including, but definitely not limited to, Object oriented programming, T-SQL, JavaScript, CSS(ugh), and algorithms. 

I will be following the [100daysofcode log format](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md "100daysofcode logger format").
